## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## K-means clustering 
```{r}
# Generate some example data for clustering
tmp <- c(rnorm(30,-3), rnorm(30,3))
x <- cbind(x=tmp, y=rev(tmp))
plot(x)
```

Use the kmeans() function setting k to 2 and nstart=20. 
```{r}
k <- kmeans(x, centers=2, nstart=20)
```
Inspect/print the results
```{r}
k
```
How many points are in each cluster? = 
What ‘component’ of your result object details --> cluster size?, cluster assignment/membership?, cluster center?
```{r}
k$size
k$cluster
k$centers
```
Plot x colored by the kmeans cluster assignment and add cluster centers as blue points
```{r}
plot(x, col=k$cluster)
points(k$centers, col="blue", pch=15)
```


## Hierarchical clustering in R
The 'hclust()' function requiress a distance matrix as input. You can get this from the 'dist()' function 
```{r}
# First we need to calculate point (dis)similarity
# as the Euclidean distance between observations
dist_matrix <- dist(x)

# The hclust() function returns a hierarchical
# clustering model
hc <- hclust(d = dist_matrix)

# the print method is not so useful here
hc

```

```{r}
#draws a dendogram
plot(hc)
abline(h=6, col="red")
cutree(hc, h=6)
#cut by height
```


```{r}
# Step 1. Generate some example data for clustering
x <- rbind(
 matrix(rnorm(100, mean=0, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2), # c1
 matrix(rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2), # c2
 matrix(c(rnorm(50, mean = 1, sd = 0.3), # c3
 rnorm(50, mean = 0, sd = 0.3)), ncol = 2))

colnames(x) <- c("x", "y")

# Step 2. Plot the data without clustering
plot(x)

# Step 3. Generate colors for known clusters
# (just so we can compare to hclust results)
col <- as.factor( rep(c("c1","c2","c3"), each=50) )

plot(x, col=col)
```

Q. Use the dist(), hclust(), plot() and cutree()
 functions to return 2 and 3 clusters
Q. How does this compare to your known 'col' groups?
```{r}
kmeans(x, centers=3, nstart=20)
hclust(dist(x))
#clustering
hc <- hclust(dist(x))
#draw tree
plot(hc)
abline(h=2, col="red")
#cut the tree into clusters/groups
cutree(hc, h=3)
grps <- cutree(hc, h=3)
grps
```

Plot the data colored by their hclust results with k=3


How many points in each cluster
```{r}
table(grps)
```

Cross-tabulate i.i compare out clustering result with the known answer
```{r}
table(grps, col)
```

## Principal Component Analysis 
Read some example gene expresssion data
```{r}
mydata <- read.csv("https://tinyurl.com/expression-CSV",
 row.names=1)
head(mydata) 
#how many genes are there in this dataset 
dim(mydata)
nrow(mydata)
```

PCA with the **prcomp()** function. 
```{r}
## lets do PCA, but by first transposing the matrix using function t()
pca <- prcomp(t(mydata), scale=TRUE) 

## See what is returned by the prcomp() function
attributes(pca)

## A basic PC1 vs PC2 2-D plot
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2]) 

## Variance captured per PC
pca.var <- pca$sdev^2 

## Precent variance is often more informative to look at
pca.var <- pca$sdev^2
pca.var.per <- round(pca.var/sum(pca.var)*100, 1) 

pca.var.per
```

```{r}
barplot(pca.var.per, main="Scree Plot",
 xlab="Principal Component", ylab="Percent Variation")

## A vector of colors for wt and ko samples
colvec <- colnames(mydata)
colvec[grep("wt", colvec)] <- "red"
colvec[grep("ko", colvec)] <- "blue"
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col=colvec, pch=16,
 xlab=paste0("PC1 (", pca.var.per[1], "%)"),
 ylab=paste0("PC2 (", pca.var.per[2], "%)")) 
```

## PCA of UK food data
```{r}
x <- read.csv("UK_foods.csv")
dim(x)
head(x)
```
```{r}
#fixing the display of the number of rows as here there is an additional x row that is unwanted
rownames(x) <- x[,1]
x <- x[,-1]
head(x)
#checking the dimensions again
dim(x)

#alternatively the following code will achieve the same result 
#x <- read.csv("data/UK_foods.csv", row.names=1) head(x)
```
```{r}
#plotting the data as a barlot to spot major difference and trends 
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=T, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
#the beside specification, which when false makes each bar of the plot correspond to a column of hieght rather than having different stacks 
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=FALSE, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))

#how do we change te aforementioned plot to generate pairwise plots = the boxes with the country names are the axes on the side they correspond to
pairs(x, col=rainbow(10), pch=16)
```

```{r}
#now using PCA function prcomp()
pca <- prcomp(t(x))
summary(pca)

#Plot PC1 vs PC2 
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], xlab="PC1", ylab="PC2", xlim=c(-270,500))
text(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], colnames(x))
```
